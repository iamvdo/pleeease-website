##Get started

The simplest way to use Pleeease is to use [CLI](/docs/#cli) (command-line interface) and a [configuration file](/docs/#configuration-file).

Note that if you already have an advanced workflow, you can learn [how to improve it](/workflow).

**To use CLI:** First, you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that usually comes with `npm`, its module manager. Then, install `pleeease-cli` globally on your system:

```javascript
$ npm install -g pleeease-cli
```

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pleeease < 3.0.0 users, you have to uninstall `pleeeease` first, then install `pleeease-cli`.</div>

You're now ready to learn [how to use it](#how-it-simply-works).
