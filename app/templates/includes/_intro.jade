  *Pleeease* is a CSS post-processor. **It simplifies the use of preprocessors and helps keep stylesheets as small as possible for a better maintenability**. This means no more Compass for prefixes, no more `rem` mixins, and so on. Everything is getting simpler now*.

  ***Pleeease* is also a great tool if you want to write plain CSS as it helps support older browsers**. Just see how to [configure it](tool.html#configuration-file) and let *Pleeease* do its job:

  * adds **prefixes**, based on [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
  * provides fallbacks for **`rem`** unit, CSS3 **pseudo-elements** notation
  * converts **CSS shorthand filters** to SVG equivalent
  * **packs same media-query** in one `@media` rule
  * **inlines `@import`** styles
  * **minifies the result**

  *Pleeease**.NEXT*** goes even further and allows you to use some of the future CSS's features today:

  * provides fallbacks for **CSS custom properties (aka CSS variables)** and **custom media-queries**
  * reduce **`calc()`** whenever possible
  * adds some features from CSS4 colors module: **`color()`, `hwb()`, `#RRGGBBAA` notation** and more

  **Note:** be careful that Pleeease.NEXT's features are at risk. [Learn more](options.html).
