  ##Get started

  The simplest way to use Pleeease is to use [CLI](/docs/#cli) (command-line interface) and a [configuration file](/docs/#configuration-file).

  First, you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that usually comes with `npm`, its module manager. Then, install Pleeease globally on your system:

  ```javascript
  $ npm install -g pleeease
  ```

  **And that's all!** You're ready to learn [how to use it](#how-it-simply-works).

  If you don't want to use CLI, you can also learn [how to improve your workflow](/workflow).
